# Bison Simple Calc

Very simple implementation of a calculator using bison

## Instalation

* clone the repo
* run `make`
* run `./calc`
* you can type expressions like `10+10+5;` and press enter to see the result,
  it's very minimal spaces are not allowed and you need to end the expression with `;`
  it only does addition but it's quite easy to add more operations if you want to play around with 
  bison and flex

## Dependencies

You need `Bison` and `Flex` installed in your machine, all linux distributions already
come with it
